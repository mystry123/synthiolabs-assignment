3. Editing component-specific styles in individual components

## üîß Design Assumptions & Trade-offs

### **Background Gradients**

- **Assumption**: Used SVG gradient image (`/assets/gradient.svg`) instead of CSS gradients
- **Reason**: No specific color specifications were provided in the design requirements
- **Trade-off**: SVG approach provides more design flexibility but requires additional asset management
- **Alternative**: Could use CSS `radial-gradient()` with custom colors if specifications are provided

### **Icon System**

- **Choice**: Lucide React icons throughout the application
- **Reason**: Consistent, lightweight, and tree-shakeable icon library
- **Trade-off**: Avoided custom SVG icons to maintain consistency and reduce bundle size
- **Benefits**: Better performance, accessibility, and easier maintenance

### **Navigation Tab Background**

- **Implementation**: Used `bg-[#F6F6F6]/70` instead of `bg-[#FFFFFF]/80`
- **Reason**: Better visibility and contrast against the gradient background
- **Issue**: White background (`#FFFFFF/80`) was not visible enough against the light gradient
- **Solution**: Switched to light gray with 70% opacity for better visual hierarchy

### **Responsive Design**

- **Approach**: Mobile-first design with progressive enhancement
- **Assumption**: Primary usage on both mobile and desktop devices
- **Trade-off**: Slightly more complex CSS but better user experience across devices

### **Mock Data**

- **Implementation**: Hardcoded medical professional data for demonstration
- **Assumption**: Real API integration will replace mock data in production
- **Trade-off**: Faster development but requires future refactoring for real data sources
